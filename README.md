# Extract PDF Content

This repository contains example demonstrations on how to use [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) in conjunction with [Lodash](https://lodash.com/), to extract data from a pdf.

There are two example applications, a web application to ease data exploration and a CLI application to ease data entry from a node.js application.


_NOTE: These are prototypes for further exploration and will need to be customised to a specific use case._


## Usage

Choose between: 

- a CLI implementation ideally to be set up and used on a server (requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed)

```bash
cd server/
npm install
node index.js
```
- a web application implementation (open app folder, open index.htm in a web browser)
